# Our Package

## ðŸŒ³ asurion aspen

This package was created by Grace Harders, Daniel Ryan, Madelyn Reyes, and Jenaba Sow.

## Purpose

As developers at Asurion we have seen that knowledge transfer between teams can be tricky.
Our options for team knowledge transfer are Slack (where messages are easily lost), Notion (with a difficult file structure), or Backstage (costly and lacks customization).
We wanted to create a new package that is specifically for Asurion developers to use to keep eachother updated.

## How to Use

To use this package, run `yarn add SOMETHING`.
In your local repository, add an `ASPEN.md` file at the root of your repository using the markdown template provided in this `README`.
Update the `ASPEN.md` as needed with team updates.

## Team Information

All team information will be hosted on a Django site found here: PUT SOMETHING HERE.
On this webpage, teams will be able to search for specific teams and find important information all in one easy to search space.
The website does not need to be updated by the developers as it is automatically hosted/updated.

## Sample Template

The sample template can be copied/pasted in your `ASPEN.md` file that you store locally.
